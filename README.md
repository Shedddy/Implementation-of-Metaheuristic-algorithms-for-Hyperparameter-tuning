# Implementation of Metaheuristic algorithms for Hyperparameter tuning using support vector regression as a case study.

This repository explores the implementation of advanced metaheuristic algorithms to fine-tune hyperparameters in machine learning models, with a specific focus on Support Vector Regression (SVR).

Hyperparameter tuning is essential for optimizing machine learning models. This project delves into the world of metaheuristic algorithms, such as Genetic Algorithms (GA) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), to automatically discover optimal hyperparameter settings for SVR.
